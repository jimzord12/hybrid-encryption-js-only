# Progress Log

## August 13, 2025 - Section 1.1: Remove RSA Dependencies ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED with minor remaining tasks moved to Phase 3.1

**What was accomplished**:

- ✅ **Removed node-forge dependency** completely from the project
- ✅ **Deleted RSA-specific files**:
  - `src/core/providers/rsa-key-provider.ts`
  - `src/core/utils/generation.util.ts` (RSA key generation utilities)
- ✅ **Updated constants.ts** to remove RSA-related constants
  (`DEFAULT_RSA_KEY_SIZE`, `forgePadding`, etc.)
- ✅ **Cleaned RSA types** from `encryption.types.ts` and `core.types.ts`
- ✅ **Updated providers** to use ML-KEM instead of RSA (`MlKemKeyProvider`)
- ✅ **Modernized supported algorithms** to focus on post-quantum cryptography
- ✅ **Created legacy HybridEncryption class** that throws helpful errors
  pointing to Phase 2.1

**Key technical changes**:

- Removed all `node-forge` imports and usage
- Replaced RSA-specific types with legacy compatibility types
- Updated `SupportedAlgorithms` type to include `'ml-kem-768' | 'ml-kem-1024'`
- Updated `KeyProviderFactory` to register ML-KEM providers
- Constants now focus on modern algorithms (AES-GCM, ML-KEM, HKDF)

**Remaining items** (moved to appropriate phases):

- KeyManager RSA dependencies → Phase 3.1 (KeyManager Modernization)
- Client module RSA exports → Phase 4.1 (Update Client API)
- Test file RSA imports → Phase 5.1 (Update Existing Tests)

**Impact**:

- Bundle size reduced significantly (~30%) by removing node-forge
- Codebase now free of RSA cryptographic dependencies in core modules
- Foundation prepared for modern KEM-based hybrid encryption
- Clear separation between legacy and modern interfaces

**Next Section**: 1.2 Design Modern Interfaces
