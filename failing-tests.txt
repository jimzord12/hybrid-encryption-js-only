Failing Test Titles:
===================

1. KeyManager Core Tests > Version Tracking and Rotation History > should track version numbers correctly

2. KeyManager Core Tests > Version Tracking and Rotation History > should maintain rotation history

3. KeyManager Core Tests > Version Tracking and Rotation History > should provide rotation statistics

4. Memory Caching > should cache keys in memory after loading

5. Key Rotation > should validate configuration values

6. Configuration Management > should handle filesystem permission errors

7. Configuration Management > should handle corrupted key files

8. Configuration Management > should recover from rotation failures

9. Configuration Management > should handle network/filesystem interruptions

10. Status and Monitoring > should provide comprehensive status information

11. Status and Monitoring > should detect unhealthy states

12. Performance Tests > should handle multiple rotation attempts efficiently

Categories of Failures:
======================

Version Tracking Issues: 3 tests
- Version numbering and rotation history problems

Memory/Caching Issues: 1 test
- Cache performance expectations not met

Configuration Issues: 5 tests
- Permission handling, validation, error recovery

Status/Monitoring Issues: 2 tests
- Status reporting and health checks

Performance Issues: 1 test
- Concurrent rotation efficiency

Notes:
======
- Tests are taking longer than expected (500ms delays per test)
- Some failures may be related to test isolation and state pollution
- Windows-specific permission handling may need adjustment
- Configuration validation and error handling needs review
